      Hi, my name is Sebastian or you can call me "Seb". I am a self taught developer from Bristol who has been in the<br>
      IT industry for around 7 years starting out as an apprentice IT help desk analysis within a law firm. I then moved<br>
      into this role after finishing my apprenticeship after a year. I then stayed as a full time help desk analysis for<br>
      another year and a half until i shot my shot at becoming an in-house Solcase developer. It was this role that introduced<br>
      me to the world of development and was when i started to pick up books on different languages such as C#, C++, HTML and CSS.<br>
      <br>
      Fast forward to this present day and i am now a VisualFiles developer with a different law firm within Bristol. I still teach myself<br>
      different programing languages (currently learning HTML & CSS) and i am hoping to pick up some exams to prove to myself that I know<br>
      the languages that I have learnt and to also be "Certified" in that language.<br><br>
      Below is a table of languages i'd like to learn (Grey), am learning (Orange) or have "learnt (Green)"
